### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/mood-entries` | GET | Retrieve all mood entries |
| `/api/mood-entries/:id` | GET | Retrieve specific mood entry |
| `/api/mood-entries` | POST | Create new mood entry |

### Data Models

**Mood Entry**
```typescript
{
  id: number;             // Unique identifier
  emoji: string;          // Emoji representation
  moodName: string;       // Name of the mood
  note: string | null;    // Optional user note
  createdAt: Date;        // Timestamp
}
```
